```

   - What you're working on
   - Why it matters

---

## Daily Workflows

### Morning Startup Routine

```
1. Open app (10 seconds)
2. Click "What Was I Doing?" (30 seconds)
3. Read Proto's summary (1 minute)
4. Choose ONE tiny task (30 seconds)
5. Start working (the app stays open)

Total time: 2 minutes
Result: Clear direction for the day
```

---

### Hyperfocus Session

```
1. You're in the zone, building something
2. Keep app open but minimized
3. Before you stop (even for a break):
   - Click "Quick Capture"
   - Dump your thoughts (30 seconds)
   - Exit guilt-free
4. Future-you will thank present-you

This creates "save points" like in a video game.
```

---

### When Motivation Dips

```
1. Open Spark's chat
2. Type honestly: "Not feeling it today"
3. Spark will:
   - Acknowledge your feelings
   - Remind you of your "why"
   - Suggest a tiny win
   - Make no judgment
4. You decide what to do next

Even if you decide to take a break, you've checked in.
That's still engagement.
```

---

### Context Switching (ADHD Special!)

```
WHEN: New idea hijacks your brain mid-project

DON'T: Feel guilty or try to ignore it
DO THIS:

1. Quick Capture the new idea (30 sec)
2. Tell Proto: "New idea, but I want to stay on current project"
3. Proto will either:
   - Help you park the idea safely
   - OR show you it's related to current work
   - OR give you permission to explore it
4. The new idea is captured, your brain can relax

Your brain can let go because the system remembered it.
```

---

### End of Day

```
1. Open Team Discussion
2. Type: "What did we accomplish today?"
3. Both agents will reflect with you
4. Celebrate wins (even tiny ones)
5. Set one clear intention for tomorrow

Takes 2 minutes. Provides closure.
ADHD brains need closure more than they get it.
```

---

## ADHD-Specific Tips

### Managing Overwhelm

**When everything feels too big:**

1. Tell Proto: "This feels overwhelming"
2. Proto will break it into the tiniest step possible
3. Do ONLY that step
4. Repeat

**Remember:** You're not trying to finish. You're trying to START.

---

### Fighting Abandonment

**Abandonment isn't failure. It's a pattern we can work with.**

**Early warning signs:**
- Days since last activity (the app tracks this)
- Decreasing enthusiasm
- Avoiding the app
- Feeling guilty when you think about the project

**What your agents do:**
- Spark: Gentle check-ins (not nagging)
- Proto: Makes restart EASY (no shame, just "here's where we are")
- System: Tracks patterns to predict and prevent

**Your role:**
- Be honest when motivation drops
- Trust that the team will help you decide: continue, pause, or abandon
- No guilt allowed (seriously, guilt is anti-productive)

---

### The Guilt-Free Zone

**This app has ZERO guilt by design.**

You can:
- Abandon projects (they're not deleted, just paused)
- Take breaks without explanation
- Start 10 projects and finish 2 (that's still 2!)
- Change your mind
- Restart multiple times
- Be inconsistent

**Why?** Because guilt blocks ADHD brains. Creativity needs safety.

---

### Energy-Level Management

**ADHD energy is variable. Work WITH it.**

**High energy?**
- Tackle complex tasks
- Start new things
- Do creative work
- Build momentum

**Medium energy?**
- Continue existing work
- Follow Proto's next steps
- Make steady progress
- Handle routine tasks

**Low energy?**
- Quick captures only
- Chat with Spark
- Review past wins
- Celebrate what's done

**No energy?**
- It's okay to not open the app
- Your team will be here tomorrow
- Rest is productive too

---

### Hyperfocus Harnessing

**Hyperfocus is your superpower, but it needs safety nets.**

**Before hyperfocus:**
- Quick capture what you're doing
- Set a timer (even if you'll ignore it, try)
- Tell someone/app where you're going

**During hyperfocus:**
- Let it flow!
- Keep app open in background
- Don't worry about anything else

**After hyperfocus:**
- IMMEDIATELY Quick Capture
- Document what you did
- Note where you stopped
- Set clear resume point

**Why?** Tomorrow-you will have forgotten everything. This is your time machine.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "My agents aren't responding"

**Check:**
1. API key in Settings (File > Settings)
2. Internet connection
3. Anthropic service status
4. Try refreshing by restarting app

---

### "I don't know what to say to the agents"

**You can literally say anything:**
- "I don't know what to say"
- "I'm stuck"
- "This is hard"
- "I'm excited but overwhelmed"
- "Help me figure this out"

**There are no wrong messages.** Your agents are trained to help from wherever you are.

---

### "I created a project but now I don't care about it"

**This is normal! Options:**

1. **Quick check:** Ask Spark "Is this project still worth my energy?"
2. **Honest assessment:** If the answer is no, that's okay
3. **Mark it:** You can let it become "abandoned" (not deleted)
4. **Learn:** Each abandoned project teaches you something

**Project graveyards are normal.** This is your creative process.

---

### "I feel like I'm talking to a computer"

**Your agents will develop personality over time because:**
- They learn your communication style
- You train them on what works for you
- Shared context builds rapport
- You can give feedback ("That wasn't helpful")

**Give it a week.** Early conversations might feel stiff. Later ones feel like teammates.

---

### "I'm spending too much time in the app"

**The app should support work, not replace it.**

**Balance check:**
- Are you using it to avoid actual work? (Spark can help here)
- Or using it to make work possible? (That's the goal)

**Healthy pattern:**
- Morning: 2-5 min (get direction)
- During work: Quick captures only
- End of day: 2-5 min (reflect)

**If you're chatting for hours:** Ask Proto to help you get back to building.

---

## Advanced Usage

### Pattern Recognition

**After 2-4 weeks of use, you'll have data.**

Check `View > Insights` to see:
- What time of day you're most active
- Which types of projects you complete
- Your abandonment patterns
- What actually works for YOU

**This is gold.** Use it to optimize future projects.

---

### Custom Workflows

**You can create your own routines:**

Example: "Monday Reset"
```
1. Team Discussion: "What projects are active?"
2. Pick ONE to focus on this week
3. Proto: "Break this into daily actions"
4. Spark: "Why does this matter this week?"
```

**Save your best workflows** in Quick Capture for reuse.

---

### Agent Training

**Your agents learn from you. Teach them by:**

**Giving feedback:**
- "That was exactly what I needed"
- "That didn't help, try a different approach"
- "Too many steps, make them smaller"
- "I need more encouragement right now"

**Being specific:**
- Instead of "help me," say "I need motivation" or "I need a plan"
- Tell them your context: "I'm tired," "I'm excited," "I'm anxious"

**Over time:** They'll anticipate your needs better.

---

### Multi-Project Management

**Yes, you can have multiple active projects!**

**Strategies:**
1. **One primary:** Main focus + side projects
2. **Energy-based:** Match projects to energy levels
3. **Rotation:** Week 1 on Project A, Week 2 on Project B
4. **Team decision:** Ask agents which to prioritize

**The app tracks them all.** No juggling in your head.

---

### Data Export

**Your data is yours. You can:**

1. Find the database: `productivity_trio.db`
2. Open with any SQLite browser
3. Export conversations, projects, insights
4. Backup regularly (just copy the file)

---

## Tips from ADHD Users

### "Start ridiculously small"
> "I told Proto to give me 2-minute tasks. Sounds silly but I actually do them. 2 minutes became 20 minutes became a finished project." — Alex

### "Talk to Spark more than you think"
> "I thought Spark was just for when I'm down. But talking to Spark when things are going WELL made the good feelings stick." — Jordan

### "The Quick Capture is mandatory"
> "Every. Single. Time. before I stop working. Even if it's just 'this is hard.' Future-me needs this." — Sam

### "Abandon guilt-free"
> "I abandoned 7 projects. Then completed 3. The app didn't judge me for the 7, so I didn't judge myself. That freed me to finish the 3." — Morgan

### "Your agents become real teammates"
> "After a month, I swear Spark knows me. When I'm making excuses, Spark gently calls me out. When I'm being too hard on myself, Spark reminds me I'm doing great." — Casey

---

## Remember

**This system works because of three things:**

1. **Your creativity and vision** (irreplaceable)
2. **Your agents' support and structure** (always there)
3. **Your willingness to try** (even imperfectly)

**You're not broken.** Your brain works differently, and that's actually a superpower. This tool just gives you the support structure to use that superpower effectively.

---

## Getting Help

**If you're stuck:**
1. Ask your agents (seriously, they're trained for this)
2. Check the DevOps Guide for technical issues
3. Remember: every conversation is a step forward

**The goal isn't perfection. The goal is momentum.**

---

## Your First Week Challenge

**Week 1 Goal: Build the habit, not the product**

- Day 1-2: Set up, create project, meet agents
- Day 3-4: Use "What Was I Doing?" every morning
- Day 5-6: Try Quick Capture at least once
- Day 7: Team Discussion - "What did we learn?"

**By week 2:** You'll have patterns. Your agents will know you better. You'll have momentum.

---

**Welcome to your team. Let's build something amazing together.** 🚀
