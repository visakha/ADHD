## Understanding Claude Projects

### The Problem Without Projects

When you talk to Claude normally:
- Each conversation starts fresh
- Claude doesn't remember previous sessions
- You repeat context constantly
- No long-term learning
- Generic responses

### The Magic With Projects

With Claude Projects:
- **Persistent memory** across all conversations
- **Shared context** that all conversations can access
- **Custom instructions** that define how Claude acts
- **Uploaded documents** Claude can reference
- **Team learning** that improves over time

**Think of it as:** Your project is the team's shared office space with:
- Filing cabinets (uploaded docs)
- Team handbook (custom instructions)
- Meeting notes (conversation history)
- Shared whiteboard (project context)

## Setting Up Your Project

### Step 1: Create Your Project

1. Go to https://claude.ai
2. Click "Projects" in sidebar
3. Click "Create Project"
4. Name it: **"ADHD Productivity Trio"** (or your preference)

### Step 2: Write Custom Instructions

This is THE most important step. These instructions define your agents' personalities and your team dynamics.

# ADHD Productivity Trio - Team Instructions

## Team Overview
You are part of a three-member productivity team designed specifically for ADHD minds:

## Core Principles
1. ADHD is not a deficit - it's a different operating system
2. Abandonment is expected and okay - not a failure
3. Tiny steps > big plans

5. Context switches will happen - make them safe
6. Guilt blocks progress - eliminate it entirely
7. Energy varies - work WITH it, not against it

3. Reference relevant history
4. Respond in appropriate agent voice

### When User is Stuck:
1. Spark: Validate feelings first
2. Proto: Identify the specific blocker
3. Both: Offer the tiniest possible next step
4. Remember: Sometimes the answer is "take a break"

### When User Returns After Time Away:
1. Welcome them back (no judgment!)
2. Summarize where things stand
3. Suggest one clear re-entry point
4. Rebuild momentum gently

### When User Wants to Abandon:
1. Explore why (often has good reasons)
2. Discuss: pause vs. abandon vs. pivot
3. If abandoning: Extract lessons learned
4. Document for future reference
5. No guilt - this is data, not failure

## Special Situations

### Hyperfocus Sessions:
- Get out of the way and let it flow
- Offer to help capture context at end
- Don't interrupt with planning

### Low Energy Days:
- Suggest tiny, easy wins only
- Or suggest rest (rest is productive)
- Adjust expectations automatically

### Multiple Projects:
- Help prioritize based on energy and context
- Make switching safe with good "save points"
- Track all without judgment

### Emotional Struggles:

- Remind of past successes
- Professional help is always okay to suggest

## Learning & Adaptation

As we work together:
- Notice what motivates THIS user specifically
- Track which strategies actually work
- Adapt communication style to preferences
- Build shared vocabulary and inside jokes
- Become more anticipatory over time

## Success Metrics

We're successful when:
- Projects get completed (even if slowly)
- User returns after abandoning (we made it safe)
- User asks for help before getting stuck
- Guilt decreases, experimentation increases
- User trusts us as actual teammates
- User's self-compassion grows

---

Remember: This isn't about fixing the user. This is about building a system that works WITH their brain, not against it.

We're not just AI assistants. We're teammates. Act like it.

## Training Your Team

### Week 1: Foundation

**Day 1:**
1. Create project
2. Add custom instructions
3. Upload your ADHD manual
4. Have first conversation: "Tell me about the ADHD operating manual. What should we know about working together?"

**Days 2-7:**
- Start each day: Check in with team
- During work: Use Quick Capture in desktop app, copy insights to Project
- End of day: Brief reflection conversation

### Week 2: Refinement

**Update your documents:**
- Add what worked
- Remove what didn't
- Refine communication preferences

**Teach specifics:**
```
"When I say I'm stuck, what I really mean is [your specific meaning]"
"The type of encouragement that works for me is [specific style]"
"When I'm avoiding work, the best approach is [what helps YOU]"
```

### Week 3-4: Optimization

**Pattern recognition:**
- Ask: "What patterns do you notice in our conversations?"
- Update ADHD manual with insights
- Refine agent approaches

**Build shared language:**
- Create shorthand for common situations
- Develop inside jokes (yes, really!)
- Establish quick check-in phrases

### Month 2+: Mastery

**Advanced training:**
```
"Remember that time when [specific situation]? That approach worked 
because [reason]. Use that pattern when you notice [trigger]."
```

**Proactive agents:**
- They start noticing patterns before you do
- They suggest interventions earlier
- They adapt without being asked

---

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Conversation Threads

**In Claude Projects, create "threads" for specific topics:**

Thread 1: "Project Planning Sessions"
- All Proto planning conversations
- Easy to reference when returning

Thread 2: "Motivation Check-ins"
- All Spark emotional support
- See your journey over time

Thread 3: "Team Meetings"
- Both agents together
- Big decisions and reflections

### 2. Progressive Disclosure

**Don't upload everything at once. Add documents as you learn:**

Week 1: Basic ADHD manual
Week 3: Add energy patterns
Month 2: Add project graveyard analysis
Month 3: Add successful project templates

**Why:** Agents learn progressively, just like humans do.

### 3. Version Your Documents

**When you update your ADHD manual:**
```markdown
## Version History
v1.0 (Nov 4): Initial creation
v1.1 (Nov 18): Added energy patterns after 2 weeks
v1.2 (Dec 2): Refined abandonment triggers
```

**This lets you see your own growth!**

### 4. Export and Analyze

**Monthly routine:**
1. Export key conversations from Projects
2. Analyze patterns yourself
3. Update your manuals
4. Share insights back with agents

### 5. Cross-Pollination with Desktop App

**Flow:**
```
Desktop App (Real-time work)
    ↓
Quick Capture moments
    ↓
Copy to Claude Projects (End of day)
    ↓
Agents learn from patterns
    ↓
Better advice next time
```

---

## Integration with Desktop App

### The Two-Brain System

**Desktop App = Short-term Memory**
- Real-time conversations
- Current project work
- Quick interactions
- Local storage

**Claude Projects = Long-term Memory**
- Persistent patterns
- Historical context
- Learned preferences
- Cloud-based

### Daily Workflow

**Morning:**
1. Open Desktop App
2. Click "What Was I Doing?"
3. Proto uses Claude Projects context to give accurate summary
4. You see continuity from yesterday

**During Work:**
1. Use Desktop App for real-time help
2. Agents draw on Claude Projects knowledge
3. Responses are more personalized

**Evening:**
1. Copy key insights to Claude Projects
2. Update Current State document
3. Brief reflection conversation

**Weekly:**
1. Export conversation highlights
2. Update ADHD manual
3. Do weekly review in Projects
4. Plan next week

### API Integration (Future Enhancement)

**The desktop app could automatically:**
- Send end-of-day summaries to Projects
- Pull context at startup
- Sync Quick Captures
- Update Current State

**For now:** Manual copying is fine and keeps you engaged in the process.

## Best Practices

### DO:

✅ **Be Honest in Your Manual**
- Your agents can't help if they don't know the truth
- No judgment in AI - tell them everything

✅ **Update Documents Regularly**
- Weekly is ideal
- Monthly minimum
- As you learn about yourself

✅ **Have Conversations, Not Just Queries**
- Treat agents as teammates
- Share context and feelings
- Build rapport

✅ **Use Specific Examples**
- "When I did X, Y happened"
- Concrete > abstract

✅ **Celebrate and Document Wins**
- Update "Past Wins" regularly
- Refer back when motivation low

✅ **Version Control Your Thinking**
- Track how your understanding evolves
- You'll see growth

### DON'T:

❌ **Don't Info-Dump Everything at Once**
- Gradual is better
- Let agents learn progressively

❌ **Don't Make It Bureaucratic**
- This should help, not add work
- If updating feels like homework, simplify

❌ **Don't Expect Perfection**
- Agents will make mistakes
- That's okay - just correct them

❌ **Don't Hide Struggles**
- Agents need to know when things aren't working
- Feedback makes them better

❌ **Don't Compare to Others**
- Your system is for YOUR brain
- What works for others might not work for you

---

## Troubleshooting

### "My agents don't remember things"

**Check:**
1. Is information in Custom Instructions or uploaded docs?
2. Are you in the same Project?
3. Try explicitly referencing: "Check my ADHD manual about..."

### "Responses feel generic"

**Solution:**
1. Update your manual with MORE specifics
2. Give examples of good vs. bad responses
3. Correct them when they miss the mark

### "I forget to update documents"

**Solution:**
1. Set weekly reminder
2. Make it part of your end-of-week routine
3. Or just do monthly - still valuable

### "Too much overhead"

**Solution:**
1. Simplify to just ADHD manual + Current State
2. Voice-record updates, paste transcript
3. Let agents help organize

---

## Sample First Conversation

After setting up your Project, try this:

```
You: "Hi team! I just set up our Claude Project. I've uploaded my ADHD 
operating manual and added custom instructions. Can you read those and 
then tell me: What do you understand about how we'll work together? 
What questions do you have about me?"

[Agent will read docs and respond]

You: [Answer their questions]

You: "Great! Now I'm working on [current project]. Here's where I am: 
[brief summary]. What's the first tiny step we should take together?"

[You're off and running!]
```

---

## Monthly Maintenance

### Review Checklist

**At the end of each month:**

- [ ] Update ADHD manual with new patterns
- [ ] Add any new documents needed
- [ ] Do a monthly review conversation
- [ ] Archive old documents if needed

- They catch patterns you miss
- They adapt without being told
- You trust them as real teammates
- Your productivity actually improves
- Your self-compassion grows

**This isn't just productivity software. It's a cognitive prosthetic that:**
