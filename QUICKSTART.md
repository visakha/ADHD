## Success Metrics for Week 1

**Not about completing projects!**

## Remember

**This isn't magic. It's a team.**

Your agents need time to learn about you.
You need time to trust them.
The system needs time to prove itself.

**Give it one week. Just one week.**

Most users say: "By day 4, I got it. By day 7, I couldn't imagine working without it."

## Questions?

- Check `README.md` for overview
- Check `user-guide.md` for detailed help
- Ask your agents (they're trained to help!)
